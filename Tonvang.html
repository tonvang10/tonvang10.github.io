	<p style="width:500px;margin-left:125px;">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I was born in Milwaukee, WI on March,5 1988. I've lived here all my life. I've been working as machine technician and CNC machinist, which was fairly physical. Now, I'm looking for a less physical career. I have never done coding or anything close to it before. This is definitely something new and challenging, which is quite interesting.</p>
